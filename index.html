            <h1 id="About">About Spicy Briyani</h1>
            <p id="text1">The term biryani comes from the Farsi phrase birinj biriyan, “fried rice.” Rice is fried separately until about half-cooked, usually in oil or ghee, and then placed in a pot along with marinated meat or vegetables and spices.</p><br>
            <p id="text1">Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>

            <h1 id="menu1">Dum Briyani</h1>
            <p id="menu2">Dum biryani is a slow cooked, layered rice dish and normal biryani is a kacchi biryani or pakki biryani. In normal biryani, the meat and rice are cooked separately before being combined. In terms of taste, dum biryani is often considered more flavorful and aromatic due to the slow cooking process.</p>

            <h1 id="menu1">Bengali Biryani</h1>
            <p id="menu2">The taste has its character even if the cooking method is similar to Awadhi Biryani. Yoghurt is used to marinade the meat, as is the case with most biryanis before it is mixed with yellow rice. This biryani is enhanced with boiled eggs and potatoes, and it has fewer spices and more sweetness.</p>
